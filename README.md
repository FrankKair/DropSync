# DropSync

A simple Dropbox client to download files or folders.


## Usage

On your terminal, call `./drop_sync_run` passing as argument your access token (found at [Dropbox Developers](https://www.dropbox.com/developers)) and the name of the file you want to download.

That's it :)


## Next steps

1) Get the file size to check download completion when using this script coupled with another services.

2) Use a "phantom" navigator in order not to open a browser to download the file.

3) Print progress logs.
